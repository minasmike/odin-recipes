    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>What is Atakilt Wat?</h3>
    <p>
        Atakilt wat is my favorite Ethiopian vegetable dish. I created it by mixing together a few different recipes I found. Serve as a side dish with injera 
        and other Ethiopian dishes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Atakilt Wat/ Atkilt wot is a cabbage side that is so close to the Indian cabbage dishes and yet has its own flavor profile. The traditional recipe may 
        or may note use uses niter <br> kibeh which is butter/ghee slow-infused with whole spices like cardamom, cinnamon, fenugreek, cloves, ginger, garlic etc. 
        by cooking everything on low heat for hours. <br> You can make niter qibe/ kibeh with coconut or olive oil(see my second book for a recipe) and use about 
        a Tbsp in this recipe instead of all the spices and oil. Since I don’t <br> usually have the infused oil ready, I add the spices to oil in the second step 
        to infuse the oil while cooking (indian food style) for my interpretation of atakilt wat. You can omit <br> the spices. Cook the dish at lower heat for best 
        results.  Serve with Ethiopian flat breads or other flat breads and lentil stews.
