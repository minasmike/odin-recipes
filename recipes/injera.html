    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>What is Injera Bread?</h3>
    <p>A naturally fermented, spongy, gluten-free flatbread from Ethiopia is made from teff flour and water, 
        using wild yeast to ferment over a couple of days. It is then cooked like a crepe and turned <br> into a flavorful, 
        tangy bread to serve with your favorite Ethiopian food. The fermentation process can take up to 2 or 3 days,
        depending on your climate. Injera is typically served with vegetables <br> and/or meat on top where the 
        bread is actually an eating utensil.
    </p>

    <p> Injera flatbread is an ubiquitous side dish in several African countries, where it's used as a side dish and 
            utensil all at once. Think of it as the Ethiopian and Eritrean answer to Indian naan or <br> Greek pita.Made in a large, 
            round, flat shape, this teff-based bread is naturally fermented, gluten-free (hello, all the 21st century baking buzzwords!), 
            and typically calls for 20 minutes or less <br> of hands-on time to prepare. If you aren't sold on injera bread already, you sure 
            will be when you taste this tangy delight—and use it to scoop and sop up every last drop of the dishes you serve <br> it with.
            Injera is often used as the base of a meal, over the plate yet under the stews, vegetables, salads, and meats that are 
            complemented by the flatbread. The porous and spongy texture makes <br> it stellar at soaking up the maximum amount of sauces and juices.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½cup white teff flour</li> <br>
        <li>¼ cup brown teff flour</li> <br>
        <li>3 tablespoons white teff flour, divided, or as needed</li> <br>
        <li>1 cup water</li> <br>
        <li>3 tablespoons water, divided, or as needed</li> <br>
        <li>teaspoon vegetable oil (Optional)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 1/2 cup white teff flour and brown teff flour together in a bowl. Add 1 cup water and whisk well. 
            Pour mixture into a glass container large enough to hold 3 times the original volume. <br> Cover with cheesecloth 
            or other breathable fabric to keep out dust; do not seal with plastic wrap as air circulation is vital. Leave covered 
            container in a draft-free environment; the mixture needs <br> air to be circulated in order to ferment. Stir batter 2 times over 24 hours. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Check for bubbles and possibly an increase in volume after 24 hours; there may also be a slightly tangy and sour smell. When you notice
             these things, add 1 tablespoon white teff flour and <br> 1 tablespoon water to the batter and whisk well. Check in a few hours to see if bubbles 
             have again formed, mixture has increased in volume, and the pungent smell is still evident; if so, the <br> batter is ready and you can skip to 
             the cooking process (step 5). </li>
             <br>
        <li>Leave batter to rest another 12 hours if the mixture has not begun to form or smell sour after the first 24 hours; stir once during this time. 
            Check to see if bubbles have formed, mixture has <br> increased in volume, and a pungent smell is evident; if so, proceed with step 4. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Mix together 2 tablespoons white teff flour and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl, making sure there are no lumps. Add mixture to the batter, 
            whisking well. Wait a few hours; batter should be <br> bubbly with a noticeable increase in volume and a pungent but fragrant smell, indicating 
            it is ready to be cooked. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Heat an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add oil. Pour a scant 1/2 cup batter slowly and steadily into the hot pan in 
            a circular motion from outside to inside. Cover the <br> pan completely in a spiral without swirling. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook,
             allowing steam to cook the top of the bread, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from pan with spatula and <br> transfer to a plate; cover to keep warm. Repeat 
             with remaining batter. </li>
    </ol>
